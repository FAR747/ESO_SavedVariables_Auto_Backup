[SIZE="4"]How to install:[/SIZE]
[LIST=1]
[*]Download the archive and unpack it to a convenient place. (I highly recommend just putting it in the folder /Documents /Elder Scrolls Online/)
[*]Run ESO SavedVariables Auto backup.exe
[*]In the window that opens, [I]click next[/I]
[*]Select the Elder Scrolls Online directory in the Documents directory. The program itself should find this directory and show the ESO folders (live, pts and etc.) [I]Click Next[/I]
[*]Here you need to select the location where the backups will be saved. I advise you to leave it as it is. Below, select the ESO folders from which the settings will be backed up. (By default, all folders are selected, but note that you cannot uncheck the live folder) [I]Click Next[/I]
[*]All setup is complete. Now [I]click Finish[/I]
[/LIST]

How to set up automatic backup:[/SIZE]
[LIST=1]
[*]Click on File at the top and select Settings
[*]In the window that opens, you will find the automatic backup settings:
[B]Automatic backup at program start [/B]- If enabled, the program will create backups each time it starts. Works well with the parameter [B]Run the program at Windows startup[/B]. 
[B]Automatic backup when closing ESO[/B] - If enabled, the program will create backups some time after the game is closed.
[*]You can also configure automatic deletion of old backups by enabling the [B]Remove old backups automatically[/B] parameter and specifying the number of days below for keeping the backup.
 [I]Backups will be automatically deleted when the program starts.[/I]
 [I]You can also manually delete backups by right-clicking on desired backup -> delete[/I]
[/LIST]

[SIZE="4"]How to restore a backup:[/SIZE]
[LIST=1]
[*]Select the desired profile by clicking on Profiles
[*]Select the required backup from the list
[*]Click on the Restore button
[*]In the window that opens, you can select 2 options for recovery: 
[B]Backup current SavedVariables[/B] - Creates a backup of the current addon settings. (Recommended). 
[B]Clear SavedVariables folder[/B] - Clears the SavedVariables folder before unpacking the backup. If disabled, existing files will simply be replaced.
[B]Enable selection of files to restore[/B] - Includes the ability to choose which files to restore from backup.
[*][B](If the game is running)[/B] You need to go to the main menu of the game so that unpacking the backup makes sense. Otherwise, the game will overwrite SavedVariables with the current data.
[*]Click on the Restore button and confirm your intentions.
[*]Wait until the program unpacks the backup. [B]DO NOT[/B] close the program during this process!
