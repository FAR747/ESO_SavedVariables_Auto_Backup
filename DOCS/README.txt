Thanks for downloading ESO SavedVariables Auto Backup!

How to install:
 1. Unpack it to a convenient place. (I highly **recommend** just putting it in the folder `/Documents /Elder Scrolls Online/`)
 2. Run `ESO SavedVariables Auto backup.exe`
 3. In the window that opens, *click next*
 4. Select the Elder Scrolls Online directory in the Documents directory. The program itself should find this directory and show the ESO folders *(live, pts and etc.)* *Click Next*
 5. Here you need to select the location where the backups will be saved. I advise you to leave it as it is.
Below, select the ESO folders from which the settings will be backed up. (By default, all folders are selected, but note that you cannot uncheck the `live` folder) *Click Next*
 6. All setup is complete. Now *click Finish*

How to update the program:
 Download the archive from the https://github.com/FAR747/ESO_SavedVariables_Auto_Backup/releases and unpack it to where you installed the program. 
(If you received a notification about a new version and clicked on the "Open the update page" button, the required folder will open automatically.)

How to set up automatic backup:
 1. Click on `File` at the top and select` Settings`
 2. In the window that opens, you will find the automatic backup settings:
`Automatic backup at program start` - If enabled, the program will create backups each time it starts. Works well with the parameter `Run the program at Windows startup`.
`Automatic backup when closing ESO` - If enabled, the program will create backups some time after the game is closed.

I advise you to read: https://github.com/FAR747/ESO_SavedVariables_Auto_Backup/blob/master/README.md
